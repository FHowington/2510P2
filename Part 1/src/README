To compile:
javac *.java

To run, 4 different types of servers must be initiated, as per the instructions


1. HelperInstance - This server is an indexing helper, and an arbitrary number may be run
java HelperInstance <Port>

2. SearchHelperInstance - This server is a search helper, and an arbitrary number may be run
java HelperInstance <Port>

3. SeverInstances - Only run one of these, it acts as the mini-google's client facing server.
After it is started, the addresses of all indexing helpers must be entered, followed by "q"
Then, all addresses of search helpers must be entered, followed by "q"
java ServerInstance <Port>
<HelperInstance1 IP><HelperInstance2 Port>
<HelperInstance2 IP><HelperInstance2 Port>
...
q
<SearchHelperInstance1 IP><SearchHelperInstance1 Port>
<SearchHelperInstance2 IP><SearchHelperInstance2 Port>
...
q

4. The actual client must now be run which connects to a single ServerInstance. An arbitrary
number of clients may be run
java ClientCLI <ServerInstance IP><ServerInstance Port>
